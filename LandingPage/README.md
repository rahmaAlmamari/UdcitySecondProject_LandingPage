I've created a leading for a library website called 'Novel Nest.' The project focuses on utilizing and 

implementing JavaScript to enhance navigation across different sections of the page.

## Installation

You can effortlessly download the compressed project file to your computer, extract it, and begin working on the 

project at your convenience.

## Usage

You can perform the following actions:

1. Clicking on any of the menu bar links will direct you to the corresponding section of the page.

2. As you navigate through different sections of the page, you'll observe a design change in the active section, 

drawing your attention to your current location.

3. Moving between sections will dynamically alter the design of the link in the menu bar, providing visual cues 

to identify the active part of the page.

## Contributing

You have the flexibility to shape the project according to your preferences. Here are some ideas that you might 

consider assisting with:

1. Implement the feature to hide the menu bar when the user scrolls on the page with the mouse.
